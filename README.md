Hi Everyone,

The GitHub flow is a lightweight workflow that lets you experiment with new ideas safely, without fear of compromising a project. The main steps are:

Create a branch off of master
Make commits
Open a pull request
Collaborate
Make more commits
Interact with integrations
Merge to master branch
