Hi Everyone,

The GitHub flow is a lightweight workflow that lets you experiment with new ideas safely, without fear of compromising a project. The main steps are:

Create a branch off of master
Make commits
Open a pull request
Collaborate
Make more commits
Interact with integrations
Merge to master branch

Create a Branch 
Branching is a key concept within Git. Everything in Git lives on a branch. By default, the production version of your project lives in the master branch. 

When youâ€™re ready to experiment with a new feature or fix an issue, create a new branch of the project. The branch will look exactly like master at first, but any changes you make will only be reflected in your branch.
